# CheckinAir
Checkin Air allows you to use an iPad/iPhone and AirPrint wireless label printers to check in children in the Breeze Church Management System.

## Important note!
Before the CheckinAir app can work, you must first follow the instructions to configure your Brother wireless label printer, connecting it to the same wireless network as the iPad/iPhone you intend to use for checkin. Please test that your Brother printer is configured correctly:

1. Pull up an email or any web site on the iPad/iPhone you plan to use for checkin.
2. Activate the share sheet (icon looks like a box with an arrow pointing up) and select Print.
3. From Printer Options, tap "Select Printer >"
4. Your Brother wireless printer should appear on the Printer selection screen. If it does not, you need to:
   1. Double-check that your Brother printer is configured correctly and connected to your wireless network 
   2. Confirm that your iPad/iPhone is connected to the same wireless network as your Brother printer

## Support
This app was produced by an independent developer, Mark Petereit, as a labor of love for my church, Family Worship Center in Florence, South Carolina. Breeze is aware of this product and supportive of my efforts, but **this is not a Breeze product.** They cannot offer any technical support.

For all support requests, please click the Issues tab above. Search the completed issues first, and if you do not see your issue listed, please open a new issue. I typically respond to new requests within 24-48 hours, and push out fixes/updates to the Apple App Store as quickly as I can identify and fix the issues.

Please know that this project is not much more than a hobby for me. I have a day job, I teach Wednesday night lessons at church and I am a lead singer on my worship team. I'm also a husband, a father of three children (one entering college) and a caretaker of the five acres of rural South Carolina that I call home. Life happens -- pretty regularly -- and I do manager to stay fairly busy just trying to keep up with all of that.

So when it comes to fixes/updates, I do appreciate a little patience and a LOT of grace! ;-) 

Thank you and God bless!
